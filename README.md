# 📝 React Todo App (Material UI)

**⚠️ WORK IN PROGRESS – This project is not completed yet. Features and structure may change.**

A simple **Todo List application** built using **React + Vite** and **Material UI (MUI)**.  
The goal of this project is to practice **React fundamentals**, **state management**, and **component-based architecture** using a modern UI library.

---

## 🚀 Features Implemented

- Display a list of todos
- Mark todos as completed using a checkbox
- Remove todos from the list
- Component-based structure:
  - `TodoList`
  - `TodoItem`
  - `TodoForm` (partially implemented)
- Material UI components for consistent styling

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React (with Hooks)**
- **Vite**
- **Material UI (MUI)**
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **CSS**

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

- `TodoList` maintains the main state (`todos`)
- `TodoItem` displays individual todo items with:
  - Checkbox to toggle completion
  - Icon button to delete a todo
- `TodoForm` is intended to handle adding new todos (currently under development)
- State updates are handled using React’s `useState` hook

---

## ❌ Known Limitations (Current)

- ❌ Adding new todos is **not fully implemented**
- ❌ No persistent storage (data resets on refresh)
- ❌ UI/UX improvements pending
- ❌ Validation and edge cases not handled yet

---

## 📌 Planned Improvements

- Complete the `TodoForm` to add new todos
- Add keyboard support (Enter to add todo)
- Improve UI and accessibility
- Add localStorage or backend persistence
- Refactor for better scalability
